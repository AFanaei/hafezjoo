Evaluating AI Agent Plan
The user wants to speak at a conference about building a simple AI agent, aiming to share code demonstrating core functionalities on GitHub. Their plan includes starting with a basic chat feature, then adding file-reading capabilities, followed by incorporating a semantic search tool. I think this is a solid structure for a presentation! Each step builds logically, making it easy for the audience to follow. I’d suggest they ensure clear explanations for each commit to enhance understanding.
Refining the AI Agent Plan
The user is looking for ways to improve their AI agent plan. Starting with a REPL chat with an LLM, they can progressively abstract tool frameworks, add file-reading capabilities, and implement semantic search. They should consider dynamic tool loading and features such as logging and agent memory. Using a simple API call, they can create a basic Agent class and maintain memory. My suggestion is to begin with an interaction using OpenAI's chat completion and illustrate the tool registry with functions for reading files and performing semantic searches.

Your outline is solid — incrementally building an agent and using Git commits as “teaching moments” is a great way to show evolution. Here’s a slightly more detailed/refined roadmap:

1. Project-scaffold (v0.0)
   • Add `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`  
   • (Optionally) define a minimal project layout:  
     ```
     llm-agent/
     ├── agent.py        # entry point
     ├── tools/          # later we’ll drop tools in here
     ├── README.md
     ├── requirements.txt
     └── .gitignore
     ```  
   • Commit “Initial repo scaffold”

2. Step 1: “Chat with an LLM” (v0.1)
   • In `agent.py`, write a REPL:
     - Prompt user for input
     - Send to OpenAI (or other) ChatCompletion endpoint
     - Print the response
   • No tool‐framework yet—just a loop  
   • Commit “v0.1: basic chat agent REPL”

3. Step 2: Introduce a Tool interface (v0.2)
   • Define a `function` as a tool:
     ```python
     def get_weather(location:str)->int:
         """
         Get current temperature for a given location given as City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia
         """
         return 22
     ```  
   • for the first tool we need a tool to read content of files in current workdir
   • Build a `ToolRegistry` that maps tool names → instances  
   • Refactor your chat loop to inspect the LLM’s JSON response for `{“tool”:..., “arg”:...}` calls, dispatch through the registry, then feed tool output back into the chat loop  
   • Commit “v0.2: add tool framework”

4. Step 3: Semantic‐search tool (v0.3)
   • use OpenAI Embeddings + simple cosine
   • Under `tools/semantic_search.py`, build:
     1. An indexing script that walks a directory, embeds each file/chunk, and stores vectors  
     2. A `SemanticSearchTool` that embeds the query, retrieves top-k matches, and returns them  
   • Register this tool in your registry
   • Show an example query (“semantic_search:‘how do I initialize the agent?’”)
   • Commit “v0.3: add semantic_search tool”

1. Step 4:
   • add logfire

5. (Optional) Step 4: use firelog (v0.5)
   • Add structured logging of tool calls + LLM messages  
   • Commit “v0.5: add memory & logging, tests”

6. Polishing for a talk
   • Tag each release (`v0.1`, `v0.2`,…) so you can `git checkout v0.2` and show that exact code  
   • In your slides, show:
     – How the tool framework lets you “plug in” new capabilities  
     – The difference between a bare chat agent vs. an agent with tools  
   • Include in your README short examples for each version  

Next steps: once you’re happy with the breakdown, we can hand each step to the LLM to generate the code for you. Let me know if you’d like to start with Step 1!
